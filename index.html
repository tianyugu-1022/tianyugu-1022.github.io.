                    Depression is a common and serious mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. It involves persistent feelings of sadness or a lack of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities. Depression is different from normal mood fluctuations, such as feeling down or having a bad day, and can impact overall well-being and functioning. It can occur due to a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. People experiencing depressive symptoms should seek professional help.

                <p class="description">
                    Depression is diagnosed by a mental health professional (like a psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed therapist) based on specific criteria found in diagnostic tools like the 
                    <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DSM-5</a> (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). To be diagnosed, a person must experience certain core symptoms for at least two weeks. These symptoms must cause significant distress or impair daily functioning (work, school, relationships, etc.). The professional typically conducts a clinical interview, asks about the personâ€™s emotional state, behaviors, and physical health, and may use standardized questionnaires.
